This Ruby project converts json into a csv file.  This code lives here: json\_to\_csv\_converter.rb

I also created a Ruby minitest file json\_to\_csv\_test.rb

This file tests a similar method that lives here json\_to\_csv.rb

***Exercise 2: There is a JSON file with data that needs to be converted into CSV. With a programming language of your choice please write a script that would parse the JSON file and write the data into a csv file.

Example json file input: input\_data.json

Sample output: output\_data.csv
